**React image component that bypasses caching using query param cache busting.**

👁️ **[Live Demo](/UncachedImage#example)**

## Overview

An [UncachedImage](/UncachedImage) adds a cache-busting query param to your image `src` to ensure the browser requests the image from the server on every render.

### Features include:

- **🐣 Fresh image every time**
  - Ensure the image is fetched from the server on every render.
- **🖼️ Use just like an `img`**
  - Use all the props an `img` supports, like `src` and `alt`.
- **🔤 Custom cache buster option**
  - Provide your own cache buster if you'd like.

## Installation

```
npm i react-uncached-image
```

## Quick Start

```jsx
import { UncachedImage } from 'react-uncached-image'
```

Use just like you would a normal `img` tag in React:

```jsx
<UncachedImage src="https://loremflickr.com/320/240" />
```

Now this image will be fetched from the server on every render.

See [UncachedImage](/UncachedImage) for more information and a [live, interactive example](/UncachedImage#example).

## TypeScript

Type definitions have been included for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support.
