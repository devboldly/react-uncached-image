## Documentation

Read the **[official documentation](https://devboldly.github.io/react-uncached-image/)**.

üëÅÔ∏è **[Live Demo](https://devboldly.github.io/react-uncached-image/UncachedImage#example)**

## Overview

An [UncachedImage](https://devboldly.github.io/react-uncached-image/UncachedImage) adds a cache-busting query param to your image `src` to ensure the browser requests the image from the server on every render.

### Features include:

- **üê£ Fresh image every time**
  - Ensure the image is fetched from the server on every render.
- **üñºÔ∏è Renders as an `img`**
  - Use all the props an `img` supports, like `src` and `alt`.
- **üî§ Custom cache buster option**
  - Provide your own cache buster if you'd like.

## Installation

```
npm i react-uncached-image
```

## Quick Start

```jsx
import { UncachedImage } from 'react-uncached-image'
```

Use just like you would a normal `img` tag in React:

```jsx
<UncachedImage src="https://loremflickr.com/320/240" />
```

Now this image will be fetched from the server on every render.

See [UncachedImage](https://devboldly.github.io/react-uncached-image/UncachedImage) for more information and a [live, interactive example](https://devboldly.github.io/react-uncached-image/UncachedImage#example).
